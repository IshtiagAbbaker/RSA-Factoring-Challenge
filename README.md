RSA-Factoring is a crucial aspect of the widely used RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption algorithm. The security of RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, which form the public key. Factoring involves finding these prime numbers from their product, and its complexity increases exponentially with the size of the numbers involved. This mathematical challenge forms the basis of RSA's security, as current technology struggles to efficiently factorize large semiprime numbers. The robustness of RSA-Factoring is essential for securing sensitive information in various digital communication channels, making it a fundamental component in modern cryptography.
